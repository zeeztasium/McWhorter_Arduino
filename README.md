## About the Project

This repository collects **Arduino example sketches** based on *Paul McWhorter‚Äôs tutorial series*. The goal is to:

- Help learners understand Arduino basics (variables, conditionals, analogRead/Write, serial, etc.)
- Provide clean, easy-to-understand example code
- Be a reference / starting point for personal experimentation and extension

These are not full-fledged ‚Äúbig projects‚Äù but rather small, focused sketches each illustrating one or a few concepts.

## Features / Topics Covered

Some of the lessons / sketches included here cover:

- Variables, data types, and basic logic  
- Reading analog inputs (e.g. potentiometer)  
- Using `analogWrite()` / PWM  
- Serial communication: `Serial.read()`, `Serial.parseInt()`, etc.  
- Controlling LEDs, multi-LED blink patterns  
- Conditional statements (if / else)  
- Reading sensor or user input  
- Converting between binary, decimal, etc.

You can see the full list under *Project Structure* below.

## Prerequisites & Hardware

Before running the sketches, make sure you have:

- An Arduino board (e.g. Arduino Uno, Nano, etc.)  
- USB cable to connect to computer  
- Breadboard, jumper wires  
- LEDs, resistors (e.g. 220 Œ©)  
- Potentiometer (for analog input examples)  
- (Optional) Any other sensor or module used in specific sketches  

You also need the Arduino IDE (or compatible environment like PlatformIO).
